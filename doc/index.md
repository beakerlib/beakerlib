### 2018-01-25
  * we need to limit the number of ways how to do reboot in the test,
    therefore we would like to gather examples of tests with reboot, i.e. the sequence of beakerlib commands and their embedding to conditions, like:
    ```
    if [ "$REBOOTCOUNT" -eq 0 ]; then
      rlPhaseStartSetup 'first phase'
      rlPhaseEnd
      reboot; #actual reboot
    else
      rlPhaseStartSetup 'second phase'
      rlPhaseEnd
    fi
    ```
    Please put your templates into [this pad](https://public.etherpad-mozilla.org/p/beakerlib-reboot)

### 2017-12-14
