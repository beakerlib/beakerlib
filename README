BeakerLib is a shell-level integration testing library, providing convenience functions which simplify writing, running and analysis of integration and blackbox tests.

INSTALLATION
============

To install the library to the /, use:

Running against non-installed tree (except for the in-tree testsuite) is not supported.


To install directly from GitHub use:

$ curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/beakerlib/beakerlib/master/install.sh | bash

**NOTE:** web install will not install scripts under `/usr/bin`! It will only
